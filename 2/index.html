                various forms. This type of bending is used by the people of the Water Tribe, who are divided into the
                Southern, Northern, and lesser-known Foggy Swamp tribes, as well as those of the United Republic, each
                with their own unique bending style. </p>

                Sun Warriors, the Fire Nation, and the United Republic of Nations. The Earth Kingdom also has a
                small firebending minority.</p>
